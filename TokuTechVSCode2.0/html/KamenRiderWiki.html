    <p>
        Kamen Rider is a long-running Japanese superhero franchise known for its iconic motorcycle-riding heroes who transform using advanced technology to combat evil organizations and monsters. Each Kamen Rider typically possesses unique abilities and weapons granted by their suits, often taking on insect-like motifs. <br>
        
        The series explores various themes, such as the struggle between good and evil, the consequences of scientific experimentation, and the importance of justice and teamwork. Over the years, Kamen Rider has introduced numerous Riders, each with their own storylines, motivations, and designs.<br> 
        Since its debut in the 1970s, Kamen Rider has evolved, embracing new technologies, modernized suit designs, and complex character creation. It has inspired a number of television shows, motion pictures, and products, grabbing the interest of fans and adding to the continuing appeal of tokusatsu (live-action special effects) entertainment in Japan and around the world.

    <div class="hongo-content">
        <div class="hongo-text">
            <p>All events happened ever since Hongo Takeshi was kidnapped by the evil organization called Shocker. 
            They planned to turn him into an augmented cyborg under their control. However, he was saved by Dr. Hiroshi Midorikawa and broke the brainwashing process.
            These events added to the overall tragic tone of his character's journey, thus naming his as <i>Kamen Rider</i>. As Kamen Rider, Hongo embodies the classic traits of a hero. 
            He selflessly puts himself in harm's way to defend innocent people from the schemes of villains. He is willing to make personal sacrifices for the greater good. And Hongo tends to be reserved and stoic in his demeanor. He doesn't openly express his emotions and often maintains a calm and composed exterior, even in the face of danger. While Hongo can appear stoic, he is genuinely compassionate and cares deeply about the well-being of others.
            He often shows empathy towards the victims of Shocker's schemes and goes out of his way to help them.</p>

        <div class=""Ichimonji-text><p>Ichimonji Hayato also was kidnapped by Shocker. 
        They turned him into a cyborg and gave him similar abilities to Kamen Rider #1, but much stronger than his predecessor. 
        He was augmented to defeat Kamen Rider #1. 
        However, Hayato eventually broke free from Shocker's control and joined forces with Takeshi Hongo to fight against Shocker as Kamen Rider #2. 
        He is a happy and lucky freelance photographer known for his strong sense of justice and his determination to protect humanity from evil forces.
         He was a skilled martial artist and, as Kamen Rider #2, had enhanced abilities, including the ability to transform and use a motorcycle for combat. Also he is a very determined and courageous character who doesn't hesitate to confront dangerous situations and villains head-on, and willingly puts himself in harm's way to protect others.</p></div>
