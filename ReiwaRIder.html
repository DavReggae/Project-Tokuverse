        <p>Ukiyo Ace, also known as Kamen Rider Geats, is a fox-themed rider who is a long standing champion within the Desire Grand Prix, a game where one risks their lives to fulfill their ideal worlds.

<p>He's shown to be able to adapt easily to different situations using different buckles. In addition to this, he also has little trouble in manipulating other players into doing what he wants, such as Sakurai Keiwa, also known as Kamen Rider Tycoon.</p>

<p>He's not completely out for himself though, as he took it upon himself to help out a deceased player's family after a game ended. Strangely enough, he claimed that he has been playing for hundreds of years despite looking no younger than in his 20s...</p>
